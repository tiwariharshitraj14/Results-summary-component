# Results-summary-component
This challenge has something for everyone. It’s a HTML and CSS only project, but we’ve also provided a JSON file of the test results for anyone wanting to practice JS.
Your challenge is building out this results summary component and getting it as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the results in a local data.json file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
